# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer and design researcher with two decades of experience bridging
the worlds of data management and the Web. I have worked in academia, startups,
corporations and government. I work best as a member of agile, highly
collaborative teams that focus on knowledge sharing and a commitment to
sustainability.
