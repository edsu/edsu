# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer and research designer with two decades of experience bridging
the worlds of data management and the Web. I have worked in academia, startups,
corporations and government. I work best as a member of agile, highly
collaborative teams that focus on knowledge sharing and a commitment to
sustainability.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on fediverse at [\@edsu@social.coop], and some occasional posts on [my blog].
