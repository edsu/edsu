# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer, teacher and researcher working at the
intersection of libraries, archives and the World Wide Web. I'm interested
in how the Web functions as a sociotechnical system, especially with
regard to memory practices such as curation and preservation.

If you want to get in touch please email me at [ehs@pobox.com]. You can also
find me on fediverse at [\@edsu@social.coop].
